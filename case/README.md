Printable design file has been modified from the [original design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6701545) to remove the cut-out hole at the bottom. You will need to make your own hole to pass wires through.
The no hole version is from https://github.com/bennydiamond/esphome_lvgl_hmi_garage Huge thanks to Benny Diamond for giving me a greeat start point with this project.
